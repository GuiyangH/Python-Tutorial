printing a message whenit reaches the 7th step

2.Write your own factorial function in python
  make a plot of values of factorials form 1 to 20

3.  plot the functionf(x) = cos(x^2)/(1 +x^2) between -5 and +5
    with axes, labels, tickmarks etc

4. create a txt file with 40 integers. and imported into python as a list
  plot a histogram.

5. Suppose I flip a coin 5 times; what is the probability of getting 3 heads?

b = a
a[0] = 'yoyo'
what is b??????

a = 2
b = a
a = 3
what is b??????

b = 0
for a in range(12):
   b = a
what is b??????

b = 0
for a in range(12):
   b += a
what is b??????

12. write a code to estimate a function:
integral from -2 to 2 cos(x^2)/(1+x^2)+log(x+6)
